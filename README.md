# FoodApp - FrontEnd and BackEnd

Welcome to the FoodApp project! This repository contains both the front-end (FoodApp_FE) and back-end (FoodApp_BE) components of our application. Follow the steps below to get the FoodApp up and running on your local system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for the front-end)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (for the front-end)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (for the back-end)
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) (for the back-end)

## Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/WebGeek101/FoodApp.git

## Running the BackEnd (FoodApp_BE)

1. Open your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).

2. Import the FoodApp_BE project into your IDE.

3. Build and run the project within your IDE. This will start the back-end server.

## Running the FrontEnd (FoodApp_FE)

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.

2. Navigate to the `FoodApp_FE` directory within the cloned repository:
    cd FoodApp_FE


3. Install the required Node.js modules by running the following command:
    npm install

4. After the installation is complete, start the front-end server using Angular CLI:
   ng serve -o

   The `-o` flag opens a new browser window/tab with the app. You can also access it by navigating to `http://localhost:4200` in your web browser.

## Congratulations!

You should now have the FoodApp up and running on your local system. You can start exploring and using the application.
